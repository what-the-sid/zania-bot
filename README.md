# Zania Bot ü§ñ

API for answering questions based on a document using LangChain.\
_(**Note**: Authentication has not been added to the FastAPI app)_

## Run Locally üöÄ

\
**Install Dependencies** 

The `Makefile` here automates various setup and maintenance tasks for the project:

- **local and production**: Installs all required libraries and sets up the `zania` command alias in your shell configuration.
- **create-venv**: Creates a Python virtual environment if it doesn't already exist.
- **install-libs**: Installs all dependencies using Poetry within the virtual environment.
- **clean**: Removes the virtual environment and cleans up the zania alias from your shell configuration.
To use these commands, simply run

```bash
make local #OR make production
```

**Start dev server**

```bash
  zania run-server dev # OR production
```

## Development ‚úÇÔ∏è

The [settings.py](https://github.com/what-the-sid/zania-bot/blob/main/app/settings.py) file contains configurable parameters that define the core behavior and metadata of the Zania QA Bot API.

For Example, You can fine tune the API by changing the `model` and `system prompt` by modifying the following variables:
 ```python
 CHAIN_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini" # model name
 QA_TEMPLATE = (
    "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. "
    "Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer "
    "Answer the question as precise as possible using the provided context"
    "If you don't know the answer or If the answer is not contained in the context, say Data Not Available. Use three sentences maximum and keep the "
    "answer concise."
    "\n\n"
    "{context}"
    ) # System Prompt used to read and understand the uploaded document
 ```
